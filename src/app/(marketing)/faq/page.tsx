      questions: [
        {
          question: "Is Astergram safe to use?",
          answer: "Yes, Astergram is built with security as the top priority. We use a non-custodial architecture, meaning your funds never leave your exchange account. API keys are encrypted, we follow the principle of least privilege, and we never request withdrawal permissions."
        },
        {
          question: "What permissions does the bot need?",
          answer: "Astergram only requires essential permissions: View Balance (to show your portfolio), Place Orders (to execute trades), and Cancel Orders (for risk management). We explicitly block and never request Withdraw Funds or Account Access permissions."
        },
        {
          question: "How are my API keys stored?",
          answer: "Your API keys are encrypted using AES-256 encryption and stored securely. They are never shared with third parties and are only used to communicate with your exchange account for executing trades."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if Astergram goes down?",
          answer: "Since Astergram is non-custodial, your funds remain safe on your exchange even if our service experiences downtime. You can always access your funds directly through your exchange's platform."

          answer: "Yes, Astergram supports automated trading features including stop-loss orders, take-profit targets, and trailing stops. You can set these up when placing orders or modify them later for existing positions."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I check my portfolio balance?",
          answer: "Simply send the /balance command to the bot, and it will display your current portfolio value, positions, profit/loss, and asset allocation across all connected exchanges."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I trade on multiple exchanges simultaneously?",

        },
        {
          question: "How fast are trade executions?",
          answer: "Trade executions typically take 100-500 milliseconds from command to confirmation, depending on exchange load and network conditions. We use optimized routing to ensure the fastest possible execution times."

          answer: "Trading cryptocurrencies and stocks involves significant risk including market volatility, liquidity risk, and potential loss of capital. While Astergram provides security features and risk management tools, users should never invest more than they can afford to lose and should understand the risks involved in trading."
        },
